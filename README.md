## Warning!
I'm keeping this repository only as an archive for future students of PJATK / PJAIT.

The code here is probably of bad quality with multiple bad practices in it. However, it has been quite useful for people who study at our university.

If you are not a student of PJATK/PJAIT it's probably best for you to leave :P
